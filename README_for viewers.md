# Art Portfolio Website Project

This repository contains the code files for the Art Portfolio website project that I worked on for a Web Programming course at university. The objective of the project was to create a website for a client named Abstruct who wanted to showcase their artwork.

## Content

The repository contains four folders, each representing a milestone in the project's development:

- Milestone 1: HTML
   - Milestone 1.2: HTML edits
- Milestone 2: CSS and JavaScript
- Milestone 3: CSS, JavaScript, and PHP

Each milestone is a branch that contains the code files for the corresponding part of the project's development.

## Copyrights

For copyright reasons, I have not included the images used in the project in this repository. However, I have provided a link to a Google Drive folder where a video showcasing the website can be found.

The content of this repository is for demonstration purposes only, and the copyrights to the artwork used in the project are reserved to Abstruct and the original artist.

### Note: This was my first web development project, and since then, I have continued to learn and improve my skills. I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.
