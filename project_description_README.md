A web programming project for a university course involving the development of an art portfolio website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP

## project description:
Project: Art Portfolio Website Development

Overview: As part of a web programming course at university, I was tasked with finding a potential client, conducting an interview with them to gather project objectives, and developing a website based on those objectives. My client was an artist who wanted a portfolio website to showcase their artwork. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end development and PHP for the back-end development. Although the website was not published live, it was a valuable learning experience that allowed me to develop my web programming skills.

Responsibilities:

- Conducted an interview with the client to understand their requirements for the website and gathered information on their artistic style and preferences
- Designed and developed the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an attractive and user-friendly interface
- Implemented interactive features such as image galleries and contact forms using JavaScript
- Used PHP to implement server-side functionality to handle form submissions and database operations
- Conducted extensive testing to ensure the website's functionality and troubleshoot technical issues as needed.

Outcome: Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in web development technologies and project management. I developed my skills in designing and developing interactive websites, as well as my ability to communicate with clients and understand their needs. This project also provided me with a comprehensive portfolio of my work, which I have used to showcase my abilities to potential clients and employers.
